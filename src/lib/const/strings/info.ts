  aboutTitle: "About Spot",
  about: `Spot is a tool that helps journalists and investigators with geospatial searches in OpenStreetMaps (OSM). Spot makes it much easier to verify locations that appear in digital media. 

  Users can search for entities (churches, traffic lights, supermarkets, etc.) and relationships between entities (a church within 200 meters from a traffic light) in specific locations. Spot can translate a natural language query into code that performs the search and then displays the results on a map, including Google Street View material for a direct verification.
  
  Spot is an AI-powered tool that aims to comply to the principles of Trustworthy AI. You can read more about these principles and how we have implemented them in Spot in the

## Privacy Policy 

We strongly support the right to privacy. Protecting your personal data and treating it in a confidential way is something we take seriously. We'll process your personal data exclusively within the legal framework of the data protection provisions of the European Union, particularly the General Data Protection Regulation (hereinafter: GDPR). 

This data protection policy statement describes when, how and for which purposes we'll process your personal data. It also points out the rights you have regarding the processing of your data. In particular, you  will  find information on 

-   who is legally responsible for the data processing (data controller)

2\. Data collection and logging 

When you access our application on your device, we process the following anonymised data: 

-   the date and time of access 

-   the duration of your visit 

-   the amount of data transferred 

-   your operating system 

-   the device you  have used for access 

-   your browser type (and version) 

-   the referrer (name of the website you accessed immediately before)

We process this data on the basis of GDPR Article 6 (1) point f (legitimate interest), as they are required for us to provide the service, ensure technical operation, and investigate/remove malfunctions. It's in our interest to ensure the use and technical operability of our application. This data is automatically processed when our application is accessed.

In such a case, we erase the data as soon as they're no longer required. 

3\. Web analytics (Matomo) 

This application uses Matomo web analytics and makes use of cookieless tracking. Cookieless tracking is an alternative form of tracking that uses methods such as counting the number of unique, anonymised IP addresses or browser fingerprinting to identify users instead of cookies. This means that this application can still provide a smooth interaction and be analysed and improved based on the tracking of users without having to bother you with cookies. More information can be found [here](https://matomo.org/cookie-consent-banners/). 

4\. Third party services 

This application uses third party services. Some of these services also need to process your search prompt to make the application work.   When using the services traffic data (IP address and timestamp) is being submitted, except for MongoDB. These services are: 

Nominatim, we use [Nominatim](https://nominatim.openstreetmap.org/ui/about.html) (Bayreuther Str. 29, 01187 Dresden, Germany)  to geocode the selected area in your interface ('search current area'). Nominatim does not process or record any personal data from using the SPOT application.   Nominatim is an open-source tool. [Nominatim's privacy policy](https://osmfoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_Policy). 

Maptiler, we use Maptiler to geocode an address entered in the address search box. Maptiler does not process or record any personal data from using the SPOT application. [Maptiler's privacy policy](https://www.maptiler.com/privacy-policy/). 

Mapbox, we use Mapbox to render satellite tiles in the 'hybrid map' mode. Mapbox does not process or record any personal data from using the SPOT application. Mapbox's privacy policy can be found at [https://www.mapbox.com/legal/privacy](https://www.mapbox.com/legal/privacy). 

Versatiles, we use Versatiles to render vector tiles in the 'vector map' mode.  Versatiles does not process or record any personal data from using the SPOT application. [Versatiles](https://versatiles.org/)  does not have a privacy policy.

Google Maps Platform Terms of Service can be found at [https://cloud.google.com/maps-platform/terms](https://cloud.google.com/maps-platform/terms). When opening the Google Street View  

MongoDB, we use MongoDB to store and load sessions for sharing  via 'actions - share session'.  Mongo DB does not process or record any personal data from using the SPOT application. [MongoDB's privacy policy](https://www.mongodb.com/legal/privacy). 

When sharing your session, all settings of your SPOT session are being stored to MongoDB. MongoDB does not process any personal data such as your IP address or other. When restoring a shared session that session data is retrieved from MongoDB. 

5\. Your rights as a data subject 

We do not process any non-anonymised data. However, as a data subject you are generally entitled to the following rights: 

-   right to information: You have a right to access the data we have stored about you as a person. 

-   right to rectification and erasure: You can require us to correct inaccurate data or – provided that the legal grounds are in place – to erase your data. 

-   restriction of processing: Provided that the legal grounds are in place, you can require us to restrict the processing of your data. 

-   data portability: If you've provided us with data on the basis of a contract or your consent, and as long as there are legal grounds, you can require us to send you the data you gave us in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format, or you can require us to send your data to a different controller. 

-   objection to data processing on the legal basis of "legitimate interest" under GDPR Article 6 (1) point f: If there are reasons arising from your specific situation, you are entitled to object to our processing of your data at any time, provided that such an objection has its legal basis in a "legitimate interest". If you make use of your right to object, we shall discontinue the processing of your data, unless we can – within the parameters of the law – demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds for further processing, outweighing your own rights. 

-   objection to cookies: You can also object to the use of cookies at any time. 

-   revocation of consent: If you've given us your consent to the processing of your data, you can revoke the same at any time with future effect. This, however, doesn't affect the legitimacy of processing your data until the date of revocation.
