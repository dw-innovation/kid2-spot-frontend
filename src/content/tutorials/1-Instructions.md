SPOT is an AI-powered tool designed to help journalists and the OSINT community in finding locations they are searching for. Identifying the exact location is essential for verifying where an image or video was taken and for gathering information to cross-reference eyewitness and official reports. 

**Why SPOT**
The tool enables users to find geospatial patterns by using natural language prompts on OpenStreetMap. This involves describing distinctive geospatial elements visible in the image, such as landmarks, infrastructure or buildings, and instruct SPOT to search for locations where these connected elements are.

**How to get started**
1. sign in to SPOT 
2. write your prompt 

**How to prompt in SPOT**

A good prompt in SPOT is a clear sentence which contains a location like a country or city, visuals clues like buildings or infrastructure and their distances to each other in unites of measurements like meters or kilometers. This information ensures the system to provide the most accurate results for your search.

For example:**"Show me all shopping malls near a traffic light with a park within 300 meters in Nairobi"**

**Results**

SPOT will display matching results within your search area based on your prompt. If you've defined multiple geospatial elements with specific distances between them, SPOT will highlight the results in individual colored circles. Just click on a circle on the map to view the location on Google, Bing, Yandex and if available, even in Google Street View directly in SPOT.

You can always refine your prompt in the field box **Your search** or zoom in on the right to adjust the search area. If you like to adjust the distances between the elements, open the **Search Parameters**. 

**Let's do it together:**
1. Enter the prompt "Find me a church and a mall in Berlin" and click search. You will see many results.
2. Refine the prompt "Find me a church 20 meters next to a mall in Berlin" and you will get just one result. 

**Keep in mind** 
The results in SPOT are based on data from OpenStreetMap, a crowdsourced mapping platform. If a church you know is 20 meters from a mall in Berlin and doesn't appear in SPOT, it could be because the information hasn't been added to OpenStreetMap yet. You can add missing spots on OSM of course. 

**Tips**

Information on location might be in the metadata of an image or video. [Here](https://www.howtoverify.info/Image/Where/Metadata) you learn how to open and read metadata. As well as a reverse image search can help to identify the location or specific object in the visual. Here you learn what a reverse search image is and how to conduct one with an [image](https://www.howtoverify.info/Image/Where/Geolocation/Object_identification/RIS_(Image)) or [video](https://www.howtoverify.info/Video/Where/Metadata/InVid). 
When none of these help to narrow down the location, then geolocation requires a more [methodical approach](https://www.howtoverify.info/Image/Where/Geolocation).
