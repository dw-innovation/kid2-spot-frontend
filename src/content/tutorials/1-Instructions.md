SPOT is an AI-powered tool designed to assist journalists and the OSINT community in verifying locations. It allows users to identify geospatial information patterns, such as "a shopping mall near a traffic light with a park within 300 meters in Nairobi," by using natural language prompts in OpenStreetMap.

**How to get started**
There are two steps necessary:
1. sign in to SPOT 
2. write your prompt 

A good prompt in SPOT is clear sentence which contains a location like a country or city, visuals clues like buildings or infrastructure and the distances to each other in unites of measurements like metres or kilometres. This information ensures the system to provides the most accurate results for your search.

**Results**
SPOT will display matching results within your search area based on your prompt. If you've defined multiple visual clues with specific distances between them, SPOT will highlight the results in individual colored circles. Click a circle to view the location on Google, Bing, Yandex and if available, view it in Street View.

You can always refine your prompt in "Your search" and zoom in to adjust the search area.

**Let's do a test together:**
Start with the following prompt: 
"Find me a church and a mall in Berlin" and click search. You'll see many results.
Now, refine the prompt to:
"Find me a church 20 metres next to a mall in Berlin" and you'll get just one. 

Keep in mind, the results are based on data from OpenStreetMap, a crowdsourced mapping service. If a church you know is 20 meters from a mall in Berlin and doesn't appear in SPOT, it might be because the information hasn't been added to OSM yet.

**Examples**
Some videos or images are easier to geolocate than others, when it comes with location info in the metadata or the visual itself. As well as a reverse image search tools like Google Lens or Yandex can automatically identify the location.
When none of these apply, geolocation becomes more challenging and requires a more methodical approach. Here we take you step-by-step through visual analyses to find the location with SPOT. 

Example 1:
Create a list of 20 specific details, like street signs, restaurant names, architecture, or logos, to help focus your search for visual clues. Even if the content is low quality, enhancing it might assist your investigation (Link to howtoverify). By listing these clues—such as street names, shops, cars, landmarks, and more—you can ensure no information is overlooked, making it easier to identify key details that can be written in the prompt.

Example 2:
Let’s start with the scenario where you’ve spoken to a source over the phone who describes what happened and where it occurred.
