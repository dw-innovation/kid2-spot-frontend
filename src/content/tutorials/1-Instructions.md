SPOT is an AI-powered tool designed to help journalists and the OSINT community in verifying locations. Identifying the exact location is essential for verifying where an image or video was taken and for gathering information fro corss-referencing eyewitnesses and official reports. 

**Why SPOT**
The tool enables users to find geospatial patterns by using natural language prompts on OpenStreetMap. This involves describing distinctive geospatial elements visible in the image, such as landmarks, infrastructure or buildings, and instruct SPOT to search for locations where these connected elements are.

**How to get started**
1. sign in to SPOT 
2. write your prompt 

**How to prompt in SPOT**
A good prompt in SPOT is clear sentence which contains a location like a country or city, visuals clues like buildings or infrastructure and the distances to each other in unites of measurements like meters or kilometers. This information ensures the system to provides the most accurate results for your search.
For example: **"Show me all shopping malls near a traffic light with a park within 300 meters in Nairobi"**

**Results**
SPOT will display matching results within your search area based on your prompt. If you've defined multiple geospatial elements with specific distances between them, SPOT will highlight the results in individual colored circles. Just click on a circle to view the location on Google, Bing, Yandex and if available, view it in Google Street View directly in SPOT.

You can refine your prompt in the field box "Your search" and zoom in on the right to adjust the search area. If you like to adjust the distances between the elements, open the **Search Parameters**. 

**Let's do it together:**
1. Enter the prompt "Find me a church and a mall in Berlin" and click search. You will see many results.
2. Refine the prompt "Find me a church 20 meters next to a mall in Berlin" and you will get just one result. 

**Keep in mind** 
The results in SPOT are based on data from OpenStreetMap, a crowdsourced mapping platform. If a church you know is 20 meters from a mall in Berlin and doesn't appear in SPOT, it could be because the information hasn't been added to OpenStreetMap yet. You can add it. 

**Tips**
Location data might be attached in metadata of the image and video https://www.howtoverify.info/Image/Where/Metadata. As well as a reverse image search can help to identify the location or specific pbjetcs in the visual. https://www.howtoverify.info/Image/Where/Geolocation/Object_identification/RIS_(Image) 
When none of these apply, geolocation becomes more challenging and requires a more methodical approach. 

**First steps** 
Look at this image and create a list with 10 geospatial elements you can detect on it. For example, street signs, restaurant names, parks, trains. If you want to challenge yourself, go till 20 hints. 
If the visual is low quality, enhance it https://www.howtoverify.info/Image/What/Enhance_Image_(Image) 
Use the first two hints from your list and start writing your prompt. Now you can refine it and narrow down your search. Did you find it? Share the result with us here.
