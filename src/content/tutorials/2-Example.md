We have an image taken in Amsterdam, The Netherlands, and our goal is to pinpoint the exact location where it was captured.

## IMAGE

We start with a visual analysis of the image and identifying 10 geospatial elements. 

## IMAGE with circles

Our search area is Amsterdam. To start, we'll look for all bike parking spots near a train station by using the prompt: 

"please find a parking for bikes next to a train station in Amsterdam." (follow steps here https://dev.findthatspot.io/64oyRroA5WoyUmvN7D7Vnc)

As expected, this yields a lot of results. Now, let's refine our search. We will narrow it down by looking for bike parking in front of a meeting center. Update the prompt to:

"please find a parking for bikes next to a train station and in front of a meeting center in Asmsterdam." (follow steps here https://dev.findthatspot.io/8ammsRKbGnZ2LsuJ1vFzJy)

With this refinement, we are left with only a few results. Now, check these for all matching criteria, using the shape as a clue. Voilà, we've found the location!
