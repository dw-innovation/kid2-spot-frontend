SPOT is not perfect, and perfection is not our goal. Our aim is to provide a tool that significantly simplifies location verification and helps your research. It can be used to verify the locations of images and videos, and to conduct location research. 

Collaboration and transparency is at the heart of our development process, and with your support, we believe we can make SPOT even better. 

**Bugs**

If you notice any inconsistencies or bugs, such as the map not loading properly, incorrect results, or missing entities, please inform us. 

**Weaknesses**

What can we do to improve the system? Any idea is weclome and will be carefully looked at and discussed in our team. 

**Feedback**

Always remember, every investigation is worthwhile when it comes to strengthening your skills (quote by Bellingcat). We value your feedback and want to hear from you.
