SPOT is not perfect, and perfection is not our goal. Our aim is to provide you with a tool that significantly simplifies location verification and helps your research. It can be used to verify the locations of images and videos, and to conduct location research. 

Collaboration and transparency is at the heart of our development process, and with your support, we believe we can make SPOT even better. 

**Reporting bugs**

If you notice any inconsistencies or bugs, such as the map not loading properly, incorrect results, or missing entities, please let us know via hey@findthatspot.io. 

**Pointing out weaknesses**

What can we do to improve the system? Any idea is weclome and will be carefully considered and discussed by our team. 

**Feedback**

Always remember, every investigation is worthwhile when it comes to strengthening your skills (quote by Bellingcat). We value your feedback and want to hear from you.

And of course you can spread your work by sharing your session or create screenshots with © SPOT/OpenStreetMap.
