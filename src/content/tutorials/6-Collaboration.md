SPOT is not perfect, and perfection is not our goal. Our aim is to provide you with a tool that significantly simplifies location verification and helps your research. It can be used to verify the locations of images and videos, and to conduct location research. 

Collaboration and transparency is at the heart of our development process, and with your support, we believe we can make SPOT even better. 

**Reporting bugs**

If you notice any inconsistencies or bugs, such as the map not loading properly, incorrect results, or missing entities, please let us know via our feedback formular [here](https://forms.office.com/e/1er3hx6GrX).
