SPOT isn't perfect, and perfection isn't our goal. Our aim is to provide a tool that significantly simplifies location verification. It can be used to verify the locations of images and videos, as well as to conduct location research for investigative journalism and the OSINT community. 

SPOT is the product of a collaborative effort by journalists, concept creators, designers, and developers at DW. Our goal is to contribute something valuable to the community, and we deeply value the collaborative nature of it. Transparency is a key factor in tool development and we believe that with your support, we can continue to improve.
